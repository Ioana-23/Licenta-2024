\par Breast cancer is known to be the most common cancer among women~\cite{link1}. The American Cancer Societyâ€™s estimates for breast cancer in the United States alone for 2023 are that about 297,790 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women and about 43,700 women will die from breast cancer~\cite{link2}. Since 1989, breast cancer death rates have been decreasing, believed to be a consequence of early detection and increased awareness, as well as better treatments. This progress seems to have slightly stopped~\cite{link2}.

The main objective of this project is to understand and implement ways to detect the presence of cancerous, benign, or precancerous tumors in the breast in an efficient way using machine learning. This would minimize the time doctors spend studying thousands of breast screenings to label them accordingly and aid early detection.
